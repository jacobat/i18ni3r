INTRODUCTION ~

i18ni3r attempts to make working with two related buffers of translation
strings - the source and the destination.

                                      *i18ni3r-operation*
OPERATION ~

For now, make an explicit call to initialise this buffer with:
>
  :call Initialise_i18ni3r()
<

Which will create a new file based on the current file with the extention of
_i18n.txt. If this file already exists, it opens it instead. This all happens
behind the scenes; you're left looking at your original file.

The intended workflow is to visually select a string and type <leader>m. This
will paste that string into the corresponding translation buffer twice,
selecting the second version, waiting for you to press   c   to begin changing
it. Type ctrl-6 to return to your original (source) buffer.

                                  *i18ni3r-keymaps*
Key Maps ~

By default, i18ni3r uses the key map <leader>m to process snippets. This is not
customisable yet.
